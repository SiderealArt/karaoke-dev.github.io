# Branch

Due to sometimes has large feature, or this ruleset cannot use latest game framework.

There's some branch is working now :

- Edge
- Master
- LyricMaker


## Edge

Use latest `ppy.Game` game framework, but not promise all the feature works will.

Known issue : 

- Crash at editor.

# Master

Stable.

Everything should not crash until it's still under develop.

# LyricMaker

Porting exist lyric maker(writting in windows form) into karaoke ruleset.

Because it's large feature, so make a individial branch.
