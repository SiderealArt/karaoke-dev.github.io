## Achievement

- \First post/

## Blog

- `This post` is the initial post in this progress blog.

- Define how to update latest progress (What's new should be listed like official lazer's change log.)

- Will create `1` new record each one or two monthes, if i don't forget >_>

- Change log will be abailable to view `in lazer`.

## Editor

- Start making [lyric maker](https://github.com/osu-Karaoke/osu-Karaoke/pull/69) into editor.

    In future, user can select to import `.lrc` created by another tool like [RhythmKaTTE](http://juna-idler.blogspot.com/2016/05/rhythmkatte-version-01.html), or just create complex time tag in editor.


## Testing

- Trying to `clean-up` test cases.
